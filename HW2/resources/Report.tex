\section{Paper and Pencil Exercises}
\subsection{First}
We have discussed elementary elimination matrices Mk in class. Prove the
following two properties of elementary elimination matrices, which are very important for
making LU factorization work efficiently in practice:

\par\noindent
Property (a): Mk is nonsingular.
Hint: Represent \(M_k^{-1}\)
explicitly and then show that \(M_k M_k^{-1} = M_k^{-1} M_k = I\)
\par
\noindent
practice:
Property (b): The product of two elementary elimination matrices \(M_k\) and \(M_j\) with \(k \leq j\) is essentially their “union”; and therefore they can be multiplied without any computational
cost.
\par\noindent
Assuming we have a 2x2 elimination Matrix M =
$\left( \begin{array}{rrrr}
2 & 4\\
1 & 2\\
\end{array}\right)$.

\(det(M) =\) $\begin{vmatrix}
2 & 4\\
1 & 2\\
\end{vmatrix}$ \(= 2*2 - 1*4 = 0\)

\par\noindent
Trying to calculate \(M^{-1}\) via Octave does not work. It displays the following error message:
warning: inverse: matrix singular to machine precision, \(rcond = 0\)
