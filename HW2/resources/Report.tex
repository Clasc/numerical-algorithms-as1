\section{Paper and Pencil Exercises}
\subsection{First}
We have discussed elementary elimination matrices Mk in class. Prove the
following two properties of elementary elimination matrices, which are very important for
making LU factorization work efficiently in practice:\newline
Property (a): Mk is nonsingular.
Hint: Represent \(M_k^{-1}\)
explicitly and then show that \(M_k M_k^{-1} = M_k^{-1} M_k = I\)
\newline
practice:\newline
Property (b): The product of two elementary elimination matrices \(M_k\) and \(M_j\) with \(k \leq j\) is essentially their “union”; and therefore they can be multiplied without any computational
cost.
